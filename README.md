## About
0ct1pus is a [brief description — replace me] designed to [explain primary goal: e.g., "provide fast image analysis", "orchestrate containers", "act as a CLI for X", etc.]. This repository holds version 1.0.0 BETA.

If you are reading this and want the README tailored precisely to the code in this repository, please either:
- give me access to the repository contents so I can auto-generate exact commands and examples, or
- paste the main files (package manifest, build scripts, entrypoint files) and I will update this README with exact steps.

## Features
- Feature 1 — short description
- Feature 2 — short description
- Feature 3 — short description  
(Replace or extend with real features from the project.)

## Language composition
(Replace this section with actual repo language breakdown.)
- Primary language: [e.g., JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / Go / Rust / Java / etc.]
- Other languages: [list]

## Prerequisites
List the things users need before installing or building:
- OS: Linux / macOS / Windows (specify)
- Runtime(s): Node >= X, Python >= X, Go >= X, Rust toolchain, Docker, etc. (replace)
- Tools: git, make, docker, or package manager (npm, pip, cargo) as applicable

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackxripper/0ct1pus-1.0.0-BETA.git
cd 0ct1pus-1.0.0-BETA
```

Install dependencies (example variations — pick the one that matches the project):
- Node (npm / yarn):
```bash
# npm
npm install

# or yarn
yarn install
```

- Python (pip / venv):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Go:
```bash
go mod download
go build ./...
```

- Rust:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

- Docker:
```bash
# build
docker build -t 0ct1pus:beta .

# run
docker run --rm -it 0ct1pus:beta
```

Adjust the commands above to fit the project's actual language and tooling.

## Quick start
Run the app locally (example placeholders — replace with the real command):
```bash
# If it's a CLI
./bin/0ct1pus --help

# If it's a server
npm start
# or
python -m 0ct1pus
# or
./0ct1pus --port 8080
```

Open http://localhost:8080 (if it's a web service).

## Configuration
Configuration can be provided via:
- Environment variables
- config.yml / config.json
- CLI flags

Common placeholders:
- PORT — port to bind the service (default: 8080)
- DATABASE_URL — connection string for a database
- API_KEY — API key for external services

Document the real keys and defaults here once you confirm the project's configuration approach.

## Usage Examples
Describe real commands or API examples that demonstrate typical usage. Example CLI:
```bash
# example: process a file
./0ct1pus process input.jpg --output out.jpg
```

Example HTTP request (if applicable):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/analyze" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.jpg"
```

Replace the above with exact endpoints, flags, and examples from the repo.

## Development
Contributing code locally:
```bash
# create a branch
git checkout -b feat/some-feature

# run formatting / linters
npm run lint
npm run format

# run tests
npm test

# open a pull request
git push origin feat/some-feature
```

Include any project-specific pre-commit hooks or code generation steps here.

## Testing
Describe how to run the test suite:
```bash
# run tests
npm test
# or
pytest
# or
go test ./...
```

If tests require services (databases, redis), document how to start them (docker-compose, test containers).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a descriptive branch name
3. Open a PR with a clear description and tests
4. Follow the code style and run linters/tests locally

Add any contributing guidelines, code of conduct links, or issue templates if present in the repo.

Notes for me / how this README was generated
- This README is a draft scaffold. I don't currently have access to your repository files, so many commands, examples, and configuration keys are placeholders.
- If you want a fully accurate README I can:
  - fetch the repo and auto-populate exact install/build/run instructions and language breakdown, then open a PR with the README; or
  - you can paste the project's package manifest (package.json / pyproject.toml / go.mod / Cargo.toml) and the main entrypoint(s), and I'll update the README accordingly.

Tell me how you'd like to proceed and I will update or push the README for you.
